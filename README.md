## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

This game shows a happy blob, expressing the emotion joy in a colourful environment. The blob can be moved freely by the user and can jump around in the game. There are also mini balls around the map that the blob can interact with by touching them. The blob is always showing constant movement and animation.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces
- Used GenAI as support to help enhance a code
- Create mini balls for main subject to interact with
- Implement user interaction
- Changed environment to express emotions

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.

This code was written with GenAI.
